Snake Bite Crisis Management System
Project Report
1. Abstract

Snake bites are a serious public health problem, particularly in rural and agricultural regions where medical facilities are limited and awareness is low. Delayed treatment often leads to severe complications and death. The proposed Snake Bite Crisis Management System is a digital platform designed to assist victims by providing immediate first-aid instructions, locating nearby hospitals with anti-venom availability, enabling incident reporting, and maintaining a centralized database for authorities. The system aims to reduce treatment delays, improve emergency response, and increase public awareness about snake bite prevention and management.

2. Introduction

Every year thousands of people suffer from snake bites, especially in rural areas where emergency services are not easily accessible. Lack of timely medical support, absence of information about nearby hospitals, and poor awareness regarding first-aid procedures worsen the situation.
This project proposes a technology-based solution that integrates GPS, mobile communication, and centralized data management to support victims and healthcare providers. The system acts as an emergency support platform that connects victims, hospitals, and authorities in real time.

3. Problem Statement

Snake bite victims often face delays in receiving medical treatment due to:

Lack of awareness about first-aid procedures

Difficulty in locating nearby hospitals with anti-venom

Delay in reporting incidents to healthcare authorities

Absence of centralized monitoring of snake bite cases

These challenges increase mortality and complication rates, particularly in remote areas.

4. Objectives

The primary objectives of the system are:

To provide immediate first-aid guidance to snake bite victims.

To locate the nearest hospitals with anti-venom availability using GPS.

To enable users to report snake bite incidents instantly.

To maintain a centralized database for monitoring cases.

To provide educational information about snakes and preventive measures.

5. System Overview

The Snake Bite Crisis Management System is a mobile-based and web-enabled platform consisting of user interfaces for victims and administrators. The system collects incident data, identifies nearby medical facilities using GPS technology, and sends alerts to healthcare centers. The admin panel allows authorities to monitor reports and manage hospital information, ensuring quick emergency response.

6. Functional Requirements

User Registration and Login

Emergency Alert Button for instant notification

GPS-based Hospital Locator

Incident Reporting Form with location details

Admin Dashboard for monitoring reported cases

Snake Identification and Awareness Information Database

7. Non-Functional Requirements

Fast response time (2–3 seconds)

Secure and encrypted data storage

Easy-to-use mobile interface

24/7 system availability

Compatibility with smartphones and low-bandwidth networks

8. Methodology

The system will be developed using mobile application technologies integrated with a cloud-based database. GPS services will be used for location tracking and mapping hospitals. Emergency notifications will be sent through SMS and in-app alerts. Hospitals will regularly update anti-venom availability through the admin panel. The collected data will help authorities analyze snake bite patterns and take preventive measures.

9. Expected Outcomes

Faster medical response to snake bite incidents

Reduced mortality rate due to timely treatment

Increased awareness about snake bite prevention and first aid

Better monitoring of snake bite cases by authorities

Improved coordination between victims, hospitals, and emergency services

10. Conclusion

The Snake Bite Crisis Management System provides a practical and technology-driven approach to addressing snake bite emergencies. By combining emergency guidance, hospital location tracking, incident reporting, and centralized monitoring, the system can significantly reduce treatment delays and save lives. With proper implementation and awareness, this system can become an effective tool for rural healthcare management and disaster response.
